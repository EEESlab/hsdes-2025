# Minimal test
Compile and run the minimal test:
~~~~~shell
make clean all run
~~~~~

It will do... absolutely nothing. That's normal! But let's still look what happens under the hood.

## Looking inside the code: disassemble the binary
To disassemble the binary, launch
```
make dis > disassembly.S
```
Then, open `disassembly.S` in the editor.

## Launching GDB (the debugger)
To start GDB, open two terminals. In one launch
```
make all run runner_args=--gdbserver
```
This will run the GVSOC virtual platform with a GDB server. The output will be
```
GDB server listening on port 12345
```
In the second terminal, run
```
riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb BUILD/PULP/GCC_RISCV/test/test
```
Inside GDB, you need to connect to the GDB server. You can do that with the command `target remote:12345` in the GDB shell:
```
(gdb) target remote:12345
```
If everything works correctly, you will be connected to the GDB server.
```
Remote debugging using :12345
0x00000000 in ?? ()
```
The `0x00000000 in ?? ()` means you are currently stopped before entering the actual program.

## One instruction at a time from the `_start`!
Try to follow how the program evolves instruction by instruction.
You can find a more complete GDB cheat sheet below, but for this experiment you can simply follow the instructions here.
The first instruction is at address `0x1c008080`, so break there:
```
(gdb) b 0x1c008080
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1c008080: file /app/pulp-sdk/rtos/pulpos/common/kernel/crt0.S, line 133.
(gdb) c
(gdb) display/4i $pc
1: x/4i $pc
=> 0x1c008080 <_start>: auipc   a0,0x0
   0x1c008084 <_start+4>:       addi    a0,a0,1304
   0x1c008088 <_start+8>:       jr      a0
   0x1c00808c <pos_illegal_instr>:      j       0x1c00808c <pos_illegal_instr>
```
Now, proceed one instruction at a time using `si`. 
For example, at the first step,
```
(gdb) si
0x1c008084      133         la  a0, pos_init_entry
1: x/4i $pc
=> 0x1c008084 <_start+4>:       addi    a0,a0,1304
   0x1c008088 <_start+8>:       jr      a0
   0x1c00808c <pos_illegal_instr>:      j       0x1c00808c <pos_illegal_instr>
   0x1c008090 <pos_no_irq_handler>:     mret
```
Try to follow the control flow of the code through the `disassembly.S`.

## GDB cheat sheet

#### Breakpoints
To add a breakpoint, use 
```break <breakpoint>```
or simply
```b <breakpoint>```
You can set a breakpoint:
- on a symbol name (e.g., a function), e.g., `b main`
- on a specific instruction address with `b *0x1c008080`
- on a source code line, e.g., `b test.c:24`

#### Continuing
To continue execution up to the next breakpoint, use
```continue```
or simply
```c```

#### Stepping
To step execution, you can either:
- step to the next line of code, including procedure calls:
```step```
or simply
```s```
- step to the next line of code, *excluding* procedure calls:
```next```
or simply
```n```
- step to the next instruction:
```stepi```
or simply
```si```

#### Printing variables/memory locations
To print the value of a variable, use:
```print varname```
or simply
```p varname```
If you want to print the content of a specific memory address, use:
```p *0x1c008080```

#### Print the content of RISC-V registers
To print the content of RISC-V registers, use:
```info registers```

#### Print function call backtrace
To print the backtrace of the levels of the stack, use
```backtrace```
or simply
```bt```

#### Print next assembly instructions
To set up GDB to print the next few assembly instructions (e.g., the current one + the next three), use
```display/4i $pc```

## RISC-V assembly cheat sheet
See https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual/blob/main/src/asm-manual.adoc for more details.

#### `la rd, symbol`
Load address pseudo-instruction; gets decoupled into two real instructions: `auipc rd, symbol[31:12]` and `addi rd, rd, symbol[11:0]`.

#### `auipc rd, imm`
Adds 20-bit upper immediate `imm` (i.e., shifted left by 12) to current program counter, then stores the result in `rd`.

#### `addi rd, rs1, imm`
Adds sign-extended 12-bit immediate `imm` to `rs1`, then stores the result in `rd`.

#### `jr rd`
Pseudo-instruction; gets translated into `jalr rd, x0, 0`.

#### `jalr rd, rs1, imm`
Indirect jump-and-link-register instruction; jumps to the address obtained by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate `imm` to `rs1`.
To provide link functionality, it also stores the current `pc`+4 into register `rd`.

#### `csrw csr, rs` 
Control/status register write pseudo-instruction; writes `rs` into `csr`.

#### `csrr rd, csr` 
Control/status register read pseudo-instruction; writes `csr` into `rd`.

#### `andi rd, rs1, imm` 
Bitwise and instruction with immediate; writes the AND between `rs1` and the sign-extended 12-bit immediate `imm` into `rd`.

#### `srli rd, rs1, imm`
Logical right shift; writes `rs1 >> imm` into `rd` (zeros are shifted into upper bits).

#### `li rd, const`
Load-immediate pseudo-instruction; gets translated into `lui rd, const[20:0]` and `addi rd, rd, const[11:0]`.

#### `lui rd, imm`
Loads 20-bit upper immediate `imm` (i.e., shifted left by 12) into `rd`.

#### `beq rs1, rs2, imm`
Branch-equal instruction; if `rs1` = `rs2`, then jump to the address computed by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate `imm` to the current `pc`.

#### `sw rs1, rs2, imm`
Store word instruction; store `rs1` into the address computed by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate `imm` to `rs2`.

#### `bltu rs1, rs2, imm`
Branch-equal instruction; if `rs1` < `rs2` (unsigned comparison), then jump to the address computed by adding the sign-extended 12-bit immediate `imm` to the current `pc`.
